# Linear Regression Practice - Gradient Descent
#### Testing out one of the methods of linear regression -- gradient descent. Conceptually, using a linear regression helps choose the line of best fit amongst a number of points on an x-y axis.

#### We can further extrapolate this idea to add other classes onto the analysis (e.g., x1w1 + x2w2 + etc.). This then becomes a Multi-Linear Regression that, for example can find a line of best fit for classes such as 'Gender', 'Age', 'Ethnicity', etc. But we will keep this short and brief.
